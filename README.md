# One Week Python
I recently completed the Udemy course One Week Python by Colt Steele. This course took me through the very basics of Python programming, starting with numbers and data types and then progressing onto methods, functions, classes, and more.

While I realize that there is still everything to learn, I am happy to have finished this course and am excited to continue my Python learning journey!
